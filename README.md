## Hello👋
i'm aaron, a third year software engineering student at mcmaster university! 

👀 I have a wide range of interests from sports (golf, basketball) to full stack development (exploring this right now doing an IBM Full stack developer certificate)

🌱 I’m currently studying software engineering @ McMaster

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software projects or hackathons

📫 Reach me through aaronloh04@gmail.com

I'm working on some cool projects to display here soon! These include a react native app called "habits together" (for tracking habits with friends), and a new personal portfolio website that I will use to showcase my future projects.
